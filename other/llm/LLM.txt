how many respondents were there in each state (STATEICP) that had a doctoral degree as their highest educational attainment (EDUC)? (Hint: Make this a column in a tibble.)

In R

Response -----------------

To determine how many respondents had a doctoral degree as their highest educational attainment in each state, you can use the following R code. I assume that `STATEICP` is the column that contains the state codes and `EDUC` is the column that contains the educational attainment levels, where a specific code represents a doctoral degree.

Here's the general process:

1. Filter the data for respondents with a doctoral degree.
2. Count the number of respondents in each state.

You can use the `dplyr` package for this, and here's the R code to achieve this:

```r
library(dplyr)

# Assuming 'EDUC' is the column for education level and 'STATEICP' for state
# Replace 'code_for_doctorate' with the actual code representing a doctoral degree in your dataset
doctorate_data <- usa_census_data %>%
  filter(EDUC == code_for_doctorate) %>%  # Filter rows where education is a doctoral degree
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%                  # Group by state
  summarise(count = n())                  # Count number of respondents per state

# View the tibble with the counts
doctorate_data
```

### Explanation:
- `filter(EDUC == code_for_doctorate)`: Filters the data to only include rows where the education column (`EDUC`) corresponds to a doctoral degree.
- `group_by(STATEICP)`: Groups the data by the state (`STATEICP`).
- `summarise(count = n())`: Counts the number of respondents in each state.

Make sure to replace `code_for_doctorate` with the actual value in your `EDUC` column that represents a doctoral degree. You can use `unique(usa_census_data$EDUC)` to inspect the values in the `EDUC` column and identify the one corresponding to a doctoral degree.

Prompt:
How do I print out all col names

Repsonse-------------------------
To print out all the column names of your dataset in R, you can use the `colnames()` or `names()` function.

Here is the code:

```r
# To print all column names
colnames(usa_census_data)

# or equivalently
names(usa_census_data)
```

This will output all the column names in your dataset `usa_census_data`.

Prompt:
how many respondents were there in each state (STATEICP) that had a doctoral degree as their highest educational attainment (EDUC)? (Hint: Make this a column in a tibble.)

If I tell you that there were 391,171 respondents in California (STATEICP) across all levels of education, then can you please use the ratio estimators approach of Laplace to estimate the total number of respondents in each state. (Hint: You can now work out the ratio between the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in a state and number of respondents in a state and then apply that ratio to your column of the number of respondents with a doctoral degree in each state.)

Then compare it to the actual number of respondents in each state. 

Response------------
To address your question, we need to follow a two-step process:

### Step 1: Compute the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in each state.
This will give us a summary of the data based on the `STATEICP` (state) and `EDUC` (educational attainment) columns. Then, we'll apply the ratio estimators approach of Laplace to estimate the total number of respondents in each state based on the provided California data.

### Step 2: Use the ratio estimators approach.
This involves calculating the ratio of doctoral respondents to total respondents for California (since you gave us the total for California) and applying that ratio to estimate the total number of respondents in other states. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Ratio Estimation Formula**: 
   If \( N_C \) is the total number of respondents in California, and \( D_C \) is the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in California, we compute the ratio \( r = \frac{D_C}{N_C} \). This ratio is then used to estimate the total number of respondents in any state \( i \) using the following formula:
   \[
   \hat{N_i} = \frac{D_i}{r}
   \]
   where \( D_i \) is the number of doctoral degree respondents in state \( i \).

2. **Compare the estimated total to the actual total**.

Here's how to implement this in R:

### R Code

```r
library(dplyr)

# Step 1: Calculate the number of respondents with a doctoral degree in each state
# Assume 'EDUC' has a specific code for doctoral degree (replace 'code_for_doctorate')
doctorate_data <- usa_census_data %>%
  filter(EDUC == code_for_doctorate) %>%  # Filter for doctoral degree respondents
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%                  # Group by state
  summarise(doctoral_count = n())          # Count respondents in each state with a doctoral degree

# Step 2: Apply the ratio estimators approach
# You mentioned California has 391,171 respondents in total (across all levels of education)
total_california_respondents <- 391171

# Get the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in California (replace '06' with the state code for California)
doctoral_california <- doctorate_data %>% filter(STATEICP == 6) %>% pull(doctoral_count)

# Calculate the ratio r = (doctoral degree respondents in California) / (total respondents in California)
ratio <- doctoral_california / total_california_respondents

# Step 3: Estimate the total number of respondents in each state using this ratio
# Assuming that we have the ratio for all other states
estimated_total <- doctorate_data %>%
  mutate(estimated_total_respondents = doctoral_count / ratio)

# Step 4: Compare the estimated total to the actual total (if you have the actual total for each state)
# Assuming actual_total is another dataframe or column containing the actual total respondents in each state
# actual_total <- usa_census_data %>% group_by(STATEICP) %>% summarise(total_respondents = n())

# Compare estimated vs actual (if you have the actual data available)
# comparison <- left_join(estimated_total, actual_total, by = "STATEICP")

# View the results
estimated_total
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: This part filters the data to only include respondents with doctoral degrees, groups them by state, and counts the respondents.
- **Step 2**: The total number of respondents in California is used to compute the ratio of doctoral respondents to total respondents. This ratio is then used to estimate the total number of respondents in other states.
- **Step 3**: We apply the ratio to calculate the estimated total number of respondents for each state based on the number of doctoral respondents.

### Comparison with Actual Data
If you have the actual total number of respondents for each state, you can compare the estimated total respondents (calculated using the ratio approach) with the actual data to see how close the estimates are.

Would you like me to help refine this further, or do you have access to the actual total respondents for each state to make the comparison?
